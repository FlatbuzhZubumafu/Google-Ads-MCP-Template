### Hints
    Language Grammar can be found at https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/grammar
    All resources and descriptions are found at https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/latest/overview
    If the query fails, a ToolError will be raised with the error details.

    For Conversion issues try looking in offline_conversion_upload_conversion_action_summary

### Hint for customer_id
    should be a string of numbers without punctuation
    if presented in the form 123-456-7890 remove the hyphens and use 1234567890

### Hints for Dates
    All dates should be in the form YYYY-MM-DD and must include the dashes (-)
    Date ranges must be finite and must include a start and end date

### Hints for limits
    Requests to resource change_event must specify a LIMIT of less than or equal to 10000

### Hints for all resources
    To find out which specific fields (including compatible metrics and segments) you can select, filter by, or sort by for a given resource, you MUST use the `get_resource_metadata` tool.
    Do not guess the fields. Use the tool to look them up.
    Once you have the fields, ensure the whole field name is used (e.g., 'campaign.id', not just 'id'). Wildcards and partial fields are not allowed.

### Valid resources
    What follows is a list of valid resources that can be queried.
